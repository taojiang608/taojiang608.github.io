Looking at the river of history, we see patterns in the flow. Ancient Greece and Ancient China, both civilizations have the longest histories in their own geographic areas and affected other countries in the last thousands of years. And when you put them side by side, you can find several “coincidences”, or Historical Associations between them. Drachma, one of the earliest coins in the world, came up in about the mid-6th century BC in Ancient Greece. At almost the same era, knife money was used in part of Ancient China as currency. Throughout the time period of 800 BC to 200 BC, the two civilizations were both tremendously prosperous in political and academic aspects, laying out the foundations for their respective cultures for the next thousands of years.
